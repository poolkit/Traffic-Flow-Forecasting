# Multivariate Road Traffic Forecasting

## Overview

This project utilizes multivariate time series forecasting with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict road traffic conditions. The data for this project was fetched from the UK National Highway website through their API and supplemented with weather data from a separate API. The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
